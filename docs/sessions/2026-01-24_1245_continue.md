## Branch
`main` - Created claude-project template for Python/uv projects

## Recent Work
- Built comprehensive `templates/claude-project/` template
- Extracted and consolidated configs from existing projects (bm-sop, opensearch-dashboard, inmobiliaria, etc.)
- Created extraction script `scripts/extract-claude-configs.sh`
- Analysis files in `templates/claude-project-analysis/` (can be deleted - was used for comparison)

## Key Files
- `templates/claude-project/` - The main template (ready to use)
- `scripts/extract-claude-configs.sh` - Pull configs from existing projects

## Template Contents
```
templates/claude-project/
├── CLAUDE.md, BACKLOG.md, README.md
├── pyproject.toml (ruff, ty, pytest)
├── Makefile (install, test, lint, check, clean)
├── .pre-commit-config.yaml
├── .gitignore, .vscode/settings.json
├── src/, tests/, data/, output/ (.gitkeep)
└── .claude/
    ├── agents/critical-code-reviewer.md
    ├── hooks/ (session-start, enforce-uv-run, enforce-make-commands)
    ├── memories/ (code_style, conversational_patterns, task_completion, memory conventions, commands)
    ├── skills/ (analyze, wrap-up, draft-pr, next-steps, write-memory, list-memories, json-reader, conversational-patterns)
    └── settings.local.json
```

## Memories to Load
- `essential-preferences-conversational_patterns` - communication style

## Next Steps
1. User wants to explore repositories with 'claude tools'
2. Consider cleaning up `templates/claude-project-analysis/` folder (extraction comparison data)
3. Push commits to remote when ready (4 commits ahead of origin/main)

## Context Notes
- Hooks `enforce-make-commands.sh` and `enforce-uv-run.sh` use matcher `"Bash"` to catch all bash commands
- pyproject.toml has split optional-deps: `test`, `lint`, `dev` (dev includes both)
- Makefile targets are self-sufficient (sync deps before running)
